# Tasks

* Currently it consists of code for learning ldd and further custom kernels too.

- [Apertus GSoC Task](https://lab.apertus.org/T884)

```
Task 1:
Create a simple character device driver which generates a checksum of the data sent to the kernel.
Provide the checksum via a procfs entry as well as an IOCTL.

Task 2:
Create an SPI bus driver which uses bit banging on an FTDI (or similar) USB interface.
Make sure that the driver can be used with spi-tools.
